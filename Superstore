#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database for the following prompts and questions

#Write a SQL query that orders the items by price

SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;


#Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count.

SELECT COUNT(category), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT MIN(price), category
FROM superstore
GROUP BY category;

SELECT item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating
FROM superstore 
WHERE average_rating >= 4.50
ORDER BY stock_quantity DESC;


#Write your own SQL query that will show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies".

SELECT item_name, category, price
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY price;

SELECT MIN(price), MAX(price), AVG(price), category
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies'
GROUP BY category;


#Come up with your own question about the data and try to answer it using SQL. 

-- How many air purifiers are in stock?
SELECT item_name, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE item_name='Air Purifier'
ORDER BY stock_quantity;

#What items are in the Appliance Sections and what are the prices?
SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Appliances'
ORDER BY price DESC;

#What items have a rating higher then 4.8
SELECT item_name, average_rating, price, stock_quantity
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >=4.8
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;

#What are the 5 cheapest items
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 5;
